### Description
Developed for CS2103T's (Software Engineering) brownfield Group Project Component

Simple `Java` based meeting schedule project.

### Techstack
- **Backend**: Java
- **Frontend**: JavaFX
- **Code Coverage**: CodeCov


### Highlights
While it was not my first group project, it was my first ever brownfield project. It was difficult to adapt to the already existing codebase and work around it.
It was especially difficult because of the numerous design patterns that were implemented in the existing code. Design patterns that we had to learn and identify, in order to make modifications. Extensive documentation and diagrams supporting the project also had to be made, which was something that I had never really done at a professional level before.
